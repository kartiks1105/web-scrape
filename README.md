# Webscraping Project

One of my interests outside computer science is geopolitics. 

In this project, I used Python to do webscraping. I webscraped all the email addresses and names of countries and exported it all in a csv file.

Then, I wrote a python script to send an email to all the email addresses in the csv file, requesting the respective consulates to send me a flag of their country.
